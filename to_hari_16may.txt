Hello H,

more notes:

Questions, at various levels:
q1: generic: what do you recomend I read for upgrade documentation ?
q2: am I correct that the IP is crucial in mounting the correct volume to the corret IP (host) ?
q3: [] can I (re)join nodes to a cluster that have a higher (major)version of software ?  
q4: does the cron-extention require extra actions ? (my cron-db is still dflt yugabyte) 
q5: would you recommend I install two versions in a single container or image ?

playbook was..:

10 - run 2024.2.2.x on 6 nodes
20 - add to all flagfiles:  ysql_yb_major_version_upgrade_compatibility=11
30 - either restart  all nodes to take parameter into processes, 
      or use yb-ts-cli, all master and tserver components
      note: using flagfile doesnt work ?? only cli can inject this paramter?
40 - add 3 nodes on blacklist, node2-3-4, 
      call those "master nodes" bcse they only run master process ?
50 - from master-node, use 1 node to replace with new container-image, 
      do not start yb processes, 
60 - use new node to run pg_upgrade --check
      ./postgres/bin/pg_upgrade --check -U yugabyte --old-host node2 --old-port 5433 --old-datadir /root/var/data/pg_data_11
      rem: all looked good

70 - use 3 master-nodes to replace 1 by 1, 
      running only master-processes (or blacklisted tservers)
      note: some error on starting tserver on node4 (third server?)
      seems tserver just doesnt run, or doesnt run correct with version-discrepancy. 
      no showstopper, as I would at this point ideally just run master on new containers anyway.

75 - Question: how do I prevent tservers from starting in yugabyted, new version ???
      => seems automatic: tserver refuses to start on too-high-version..

80 - monitor phaase... .. ok

90 - use 1 of the new nodes to upgrade catalog (well this work on blacklisted node?)
      yb-admin --master_addresses $MASTERS upgrade_ysql_major_version_catalog
      => no errors...so this looks OK, but check error later, step 130 ?

100 - replace nodes 5-6-7 one by one with new container-image to run tservers in newer version, 
      rem: flagfile does not keep compatibility=11, needs manual inject via cli
      note: do all nodes. do not forget...(manual work at the moment..)

105 - seems we need to stop and start all nodes, 1-by-1, with yugabyted --upgrade=true
        but "--upgrade" can not be found in yugabyted ???

110 - monitor phase..
120 - re-verify all processes are new version
130 - promote autoflag: ./bin/yb-admin -master_addresses $MASTERS promote_auto_flags
        => Error... something about incomplete catalog-upgrade ?

140 - upgraqde catalog: ./bin/yb-admin -master_addresses $MASTERS upgrade_ysql
      in case timeout, use  -timeout_ms 180000 
        => successfully upgrade ?? .. despite errors in step above..

150 - monitor...
160 - disable mixed mode, unset compatibility= (remove from flagfile, restart...)
      rem: did a stop/start of all yugabyted instances (6 nodes)

170 - finalize: yb-admin --master_addresses $MASTERS finalize_upgrade
      rem: this seems to include "promote autoflags"
      ends with "YSQL successfully upgraded to latest version"

180 - monitor...
190 - remove nodes from blacklist, to use full cluster again
200 - run analyze 


remarks:

rem1: the user for major upgrade, does it have to be different from "yugabyte" (is it used to stage objects?)
and if "yugabyte" is allowed, can I set the name in the flagfiles (both master and tserver?) and thus save me the trouble of creating the user ?
rem1.1: I didnt create this user, and it seems to have upgraded anyway.. ? 

rem2: the parameter: ysql_yb_major_version_upgrade_compatibility, when entered in flagfile, does not seem to come into effect. 
It only got into my varz by using the command yb-ts-cli set_flag ....
hence did a lot of repeats: yb_ts_cli set_flag ...
