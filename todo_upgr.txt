Hello H,

I'd like to try upgrading a containerized-setup.
containers are pulled from yugabuytedb/yugabyte:<tags>

my setup is: 
 - 4 nodes using the docker image 2024.2.2.3-b1
 - volumes mounted externally, using -v, mapped to /root/var
   every container has data-volumes mounted, no shared mounts (yet) 
 - cluster managed by yugabyted.
 - all nodes have both master and tservers running (no dedicated masternodes)
 - dedicated flagfiles for master and tserver, but identical on all nodes.
 - I use command  "tail -f /dev/null ", this keeps container running after yugabyted stop.
scripts+code on request..

notice that this setup as a few peculiarities:
 - every image only contains 1 version, so far.
 - volumes of data can survice container-recreates.
 - I can remove + recreate containers with same name, hostname and even same IP, 
 - I can thus mount data-volumes into new versions

my desired setup for upgrade would be: 
step1: remove a node (a container), without formally remooving the node forom the cluster.
step2: re-create container with new image, but same name (and IP?) and mount the volume to it
step3: 

more notes:
 - can I 
Questions, at various levels:
q1: generic: what do you recomend I read for upgrade documentation ?
q2: am I correct that the IP is crucial in mounting the correct volume to the corret IP (host) ?
q3: can I (re)join nodes to a cluster that have a higher (major)version of software ?  
q4: does the cron-extention require extra actions ? (my cron-db is still dflt yugabyte) 
q3: would you recommend I install two versions in a single container or image ?
